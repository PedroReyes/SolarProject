# SolarProject
This project is used a support for solar data collection and analysis

# How to
To make work this package in my RShiny applications I went to this tutorial: https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/.

After following the tutorial I just installed the package in RStudio using the next commands: 

* install.packages("devtools") 
* library(devtools)
* install_github('SolarProject','PedroReyes')
* another option is to use: install_github('PedroReyes/SolarProject')

If any change is introduced into the code of the package the next commands must be followed:

* Commit the new changes
* Push the code into the github repository
* Use again the install_github_command
